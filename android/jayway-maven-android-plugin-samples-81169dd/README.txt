ANDROID MAVEN PLUGIN - SAMPLES
===============================================================================

The project home page is at http://code.google.com/p/maven-android-plugin

Documentation can be found there as well as in README.txt files in the folders
of the different examples.

To run all projects you will need the support library and other libraries from the
SDK deployed to your Maven repository. Use the Maven Android SDK Deployer to do that.
